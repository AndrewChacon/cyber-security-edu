Try to uncover every feature in the app that the user can access by browsing through its pages and investigating links, access functionalities you don't typically use. 
Sign up for accounts at every privilege level, be able to see what the app looks like from the perspective of different level users. 
This will help give you a rough understand of the attack surface of the application, which is all of the different points an attacker can try and gain entry. 
Afterwards we can go more in-depth to find out the structure of the app and what kinds of technologies they used to build it.
