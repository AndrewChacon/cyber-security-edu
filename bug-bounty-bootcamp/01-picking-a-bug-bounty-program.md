### State Of The Industry
A bug bounty program is an initiative in which a company invites hackers to attack their services.
In 1996 Netscape launched the first ever bug bounty program, the company encouraged users to report bugs found.
Crowd sourcing security testing to the world. 
### Asset Types
an asset is an application, website, or product that can be hacked.
Each asset has its own requirements and pros and cons.
Choose a program that best plays to your strengths, experience level, and preferences.
### Social Sites And Applications
Anything labeled as a social site has high potential for vulnerabilities due to these kinds of applications being large and having complex features.
Social applications refers to any site that allows users to interact with other users.

### General Web Applications

### Mobile Applications

### Source Code And Executables

### Hardware And IoT

### Bug Bounty Platforms
These platforms are areas in which companies host their own programs.
They directly award hackers with money as well as a boost in their reputation.
They also serve are an intermediary between hackers and security teams.
From a hackers POV they serve as a centralized way to submit reports and a way to get recognized and paid for what you do.
#### The Pros
They provide a lot of transparency about their process as they disclose reports and metrics about the companies triage rates, payout, and response times. 
Wont have to worry about emailing security teams, following up on reports, and providing payment and tax info every time a vulnerability report gets submitted. 
As a third party they also step in during conflict resolution and legal protection. 
#### The Cons
Some hackers dislike how these platforms deal with reports and how they get handled. 
They also break communication between the hacker and developer. 
Public programs are often overcrowded due to the exposure platforms give. 
### Scope, Payout, and Response Time

#### Program Scope
A programs scope specifies how your allowed to hack.
There are two types of scopes:
- asset: tells you which subdomains, products, and applications you can hack. 
- vulnerability: specifies which vulnerabilities the company accepts as valid bugs.
An asset that is out of scope is illegal to hack. 
Assets that are in scope are valid to hack and work on as part of their program. 
A program with a big asset scope is good for beginners to start as there is lots of room to find vulnerabilities. 
#### Payout Amounts
There are two types of payment programs:
- vulnerability disclosure programs: they don't pay
- bug bounty programs: there more severe the vulnerability the bigger the payout
You can find a programs payout information in their `payout table` section. 
#### Response Time
Prioritize programs that have fast response times.
Some companies will handle and resolve reports in a few days while others may take weeks or months to finalize their fixes. 
### Private Programs
these are programs that are invite only, you get in if a company sees you have a proven track record and invite you to attack their system.
The response times and competition is a lot lower since there are fewer people. 
Getting invited isn't difficult once you've found a couple of bugs, build up a reputation. 
Focus on submitting high impact vulnerability, these reward you with higher reputation points.
